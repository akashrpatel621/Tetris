**April 9th, 2019:**

Up until this date, the final project was finalized and an external library was selected. Tetris will be using the Open Graphics Library
(OpenGL). A project in Visual Studios was configured with OpenGL to open a window without having any errors. This will allow for an already
set up library to further develop Tetris' graphics. Needed to download OpenGL with GLFW and set up the project according to a tutorial.

*The plan for next week:*
Get familiar with ofxGui to create a user interface to start a game of Tetris. Mainly focus on writting code for the algorithms to run Tetrus.

**April 16th, 2019:**
Up unitl this date, I have familiarized myself with OpenFrameworks and the already integrated graphics librarie. This week I loaded a background
image to be applied to the window that pops up. After this, I created the base of my game, which will be a square referenced in terms of Tetris,
as the game block. An individuale game block represents one unit and the game board is made up up X by Y game blocks. Game blocks will also be used
later on to create the Tetromino pieces. I have initialized a game board and also the graphics that go along with it so that the game board is visible
when the program is run. 

*The plan for next week:*
Create all the different teromino pieces with the game block which have already been created. Create a method to randomly generate one of the
tetrominoes every time interval. I also want to get familiar with using the physics libary to greate the gravitional effect when the tetromino falls.
