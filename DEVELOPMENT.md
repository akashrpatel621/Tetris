**April 9th, 2019:**

Up until this date, the final project was finalized and an external library was selected. Tetris will be using the Open Graphics Library
(OpenGL). A project in Visual Studios was configured with OpenGl to open a window without having any errors. This will allow for an already
set up library to further develope Tetris' graphics. Needed to download OpenGl with GLFW and set up the project according to a tutorial.

*The plan for next week:*
Get familiar with ofxGui to create a user interface to start a game of Tetris. Mainly focus on writting code for the algorithms to run Tetrus.
