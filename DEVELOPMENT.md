**April 9th, 2019:**

Up until this date, the final project was finalized and an external library was selected. Tetris will be using the Open Graphics Library
(OpenGL). A project in Visual Studios was configured with OpenGL to open a window without having any errors. This will allow for an already
set up library to further develop Tetris' graphics. Needed to download OpenGL with GLFW and set up the project according to a tutorial.

*The plan for next week:*
Get familiar with ofxGui to create a user interface to start a game of Tetris. Mainly focus on writting code for the algorithms to run Tetrus.

**April 16th, 2019:**
Up unitl this date, I have familiarized myself with OpenFrameworks and the already integrated graphic libraries. This week I loaded a background
image to be applied to the window that pops up. After this, started to create the base of my game, which will be a square called game blocks. 
These game blocks will be used to create the game board and also the the tetromino peices. To create the individuale game blocks I used ofxGraphics 
to create a simple game block with a fill color and an outline. I also created a game board using the small squares already created. The game board 
can be seen in the window when it is opened. 

*The plan for next week:*
Create all the different teromino pieces with the game block which have already been created. Create a method to randomly generate one of the
tetrominoes every time interval. I also want to get familiar with using the physics libary to greate the gravitional effect when the tetromino falls.
